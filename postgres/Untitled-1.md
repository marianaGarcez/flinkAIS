–  The surveyed ensemble-based methods still seem completely unrelated to trajectory management. 
Even the latest addition of the method by Sagbas and Balli (2023) focuses specifically on human 
motion based on smart watch data and does not seem suitable for generic trajectories as the rest of the 
presented algorithms. If this holds, I recommend removing this section from the paper.

–  The learning-based methods also concern outlier trajectories in a collection and are clearly out of scope. 
There is no explanation how such techniques can be used for outlier detection in single trajectories. 
If this holds, I recommend removing (or at least condensing) this section from the paper.


 Comments: Revise state-of-the art methods (sliding window-, learning-, ensemble-based) in Section 2.
